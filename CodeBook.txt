by Grant Davis 2/21/15

"averages" (data frame) or "run_analysis_tidy_data.csv" (output file)
   A data frame containing tidy data for the result of the course project.
   Row records are for each unique combination of "activity" and "subject" in the experiment.
   Column variables are described following.

"activity"
   A string indicating the kind of physical activity.
   These have been converted from the coded activity values in the original data.
   Values are:
      "WALKING
      "WALKING_UPSTAIRS
      "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
      "SITTING
      "STANDING
      "LAYING

"subject"
   The integer number of the test subject.

variables
   The variables contain averages of various mean and standard deviation statistics from the experiment results.
   Refer to the original experiment and dataset documentation for explanations of these statistics.
   The column names are the same as the statistic names:
